                <h1>Industry<span> Data</span></h1>
                <p> In this section we further explore the 'Ideal Jobs' of each individual to identify their demand, the skills (IT-specific and general) required for these jobs and the restive demand for these speicifc skills. This will all be determined by reviewing industry data to which we will also idenitfy skills in demand that fall outside the groups 'required skill set'. </p><!-- short description of page -->

                <p>The following jobs have been ranked based on each team members ideal jobs. The method which is best ranked by employers is shown below. The order was arranged according to the Australian government “market worth” and “salary worth”, starting with the highest played profession to the lowest paid. Also, important to mention that since a strong correlation between salary and market demand exists, a consideration on job availability as well as future market potential will be used to rank the teams’ positions. These factors will be expanded on in this section of the report. The order below shows strongest to weakest ideal jobs.</p>

                <p></p>



                <h2> Question 1 : What are the Job Titles for your group's ideal jobs? How do each of these rank in terms of demand from employers? </h2>
                  <p>In ranking each member’s ideal job in terms of employer demand we have taken into account three main factors across three different datasets for a comprehensive analysis. These are:</p>

                  <h4> Average annual salary:</h4>
                  <p>The first factor used to determine demand was calculated by assessing the average salary the specific ‘ideal job’ is expected to receive annually in Australia. The logic of this was that jobs with larger salaries were expected to be as such partly due to the given demand for the job at the time. This was determined using websites such as ‘PayScale’ to attain these figures. Yet, we understand demand is not the only factor that determines salary (e.g. difficulty or skill requirements) and explains why this factor only makes up one third of our analysis in ranking ideal job demand.</p>

                  <h4> Current shortage & future demand:</h4>
                  <p>The National Skills Commission of the Australian Government recently released the ‘Skills Priority List’ report (2021). This report lists many of the job positions available in Australia alongside the current state of each specific job in the market (shortage of jobs / no shortage) and the job’s expected future demand.</p>

                  <h4>Burning Glass data (# of job listings):</h4>
                  <p> The provided Burning Glass data documents provide graphs presenting jobs of the IT industry ranked based on the number of listings/posts available for a specific job title (Appendix ref*). However, the annual dataset’s only account for postings between May 2016 - March 2018, and given the fluctuations of the job market may not reflect those of the current day - nonetheless are further reasons for providing multiple measurements for ranking our ideal jobs.</p>

                  <h3> Findings:</h3>
                  <p>Given all the data results and ideal job industries tended to vary, the following ranking is only speculative and based on the pool of data analysed.</p>

                  <h4>Albert: Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) </h4>
                  <p> With an average annual salary of $177,000 AUD, the role of Chief Information Security Officer was the highest paid ideal job of the group. The Australian ‘Skills Priority List’ (2021) also deemed this job as currently in shortage with an expected strong future demand. As for the burning glass data, the role of ‘ICT security specialist’ appeared once in the May 2016- May 2017 Top Titles graph, yet remained near the bottom of the chart with around 1,354 postings found. Later years showed no sign of this role conveying a dramatic decrease in security related postings at the time. However, on the more general Burning Glass chart, ‘Top Occupations 2017-2018’, security related jobs were more prominent with 2,914 posts found for ‘Cyber /Information Security Engineer / Analyst’ and 1716 for ‘Information Security Analyst’. In all this job would rank near the top of our group given the data and overall demand.</p>

                  <h4> Kelvin: Senior Full Stack Developer </h4>
                  <p> The role of a Senior Full Stack Developer averaged around a $125,000 AUD annual salary, and also was deemed in shortage with a strong future demand by the National Skills Commission report (2021). The role of a Full Stack Developer did not show up on the burning glass ‘Top Titles’ chart between 2016-2017, but placed on the chart (although on the lower-end) with 286 posts between Feb 2017- Feb 2018, and furthermore 344 postings between March 2017- March 2018, showing a slight but evident increase. Full stack developers were not listed on the ‘Top Occupations’ chart, however, software developers ranked #1 and web developers #6, and whilst not the same both share many transferable skills with those of Full Stack Developers. Given all the data both Kelvin and Albert’s ideal jobs show a very similar trend for demand.</p>

                  <h4> Ron: Senior Civil Engineer  </h4>
                  <p> At $117,000 AUD the average salary for a senior civil engineer remains relatively high amongst the group. Like those previously mentioned, this role is currently in shortage with a strong future demand. Given Burning Glass data is only applicable to IT specific jobs, data surrounding Civil engineers was not included. Yet, the ‘Australian Engineering Vacancies Report’ (2019), which identifies trends between jobs within the engineering industry, stated as a key point that “civil engineering vacancies continue to dominate the Australian engineering employment landscape” (Engineering Australia, Key points section). Furthermore, regarding the wider Australian job market, overall civil engineering is still considered to be a highly demanded job, placing 36th on a relevant article of highest demanded jobs in Australia (Indeed 2021). Overall, a job in high demand both currently and expected to be in the future, yet remains hard to gauge against those ideal jobs amongst the group specific to the IT sector.
                  </p>

                  <h4> Anin: Supply Chain Officer </h4>
                  <p>Supply Chain Officers were estimated to receive $101,000 AUD annually placing it at the mid-level amongst the group in this regard. Whilst the future demand prospects for this job were strong, unlike the others this role was not currently in shortage, highlighting less of a demand than those already mentioned. Again, due to the IT specific focus of the Burning Glass data no data was found on this role here, however, a recent report ‘After the Storm’ by Burning Glass (2021) specified ‘Logistics and Supply Chain Management’ as the highest demanded field (US based) post COVID-19, and one of the few sectors to have actually grown as a result of the pandemic. This shows a higher demand for this role in the US rather than Australia but regardless an increase demand expected for future years.</p>

                  <h4> Al: Desktop Support Technician </h4>
                  <p> An annual salary of $61,000 AUD led the role of desktop support technician to be ranked lowest of the group in this regard and may be due to the job not being one of a leadership position like majority of the other ‘ideal jobs’. Same to that of the Supply Chain officer this role had a strong future demand and is not currently in shortage. In the Burning Glass ‘Top Occupations’ chart (2018), although not explicitly mentioned, numerous support-related roles that fell within a officer position were mentioned and placed quite high on the chart (e.g. Help Desk Officer & Network Support Officer). Overall data showed good demand for similar roles that may share transferable skills and have better salaries, yet the role is expected to grow in demand overtime.</p>

                  <h4> Ivan: Data Analyst  </h4>
                  <p> Averaging at $72,000 AUD annually, the salary of the data analyst is slightly lower than other ideal jobs, however this could possibly be due to the fact this ideal job does not take on a senior/managerial role either. This was the only role that only had a ‘moderate’ future demand, also paired with the fact that there is currently no shortage or large demand (National Skills Commission 2021). Whilst the Data Analyst role was not specifically listed on the Burning Glass charts, other analyst related jobs, such as ‘Systems Analyst’ and ‘Service Desk Analyst’ consistently ranked near the top of every chart. Although there may be a lack of consistency amongst the job title, other analyst roles that may possess transferable skills show large promise for the future.</p>


              <h2> Question 2: From your group's ideal jobs, you can identify a set of skills required for these jobs (we will refer to this as your group's required skill set). These can be divided into general skills (communication, problem solving, writing etc) and IT-specific skills (JavaScript, SQL, etc).</h2>

                <h2> Question 3a: How do the IT-specific skills in your required skill set rank in terms of demand from employers?</h2>
                <p>As a collective, the team distributes a unique verity of positions. As such, some technical skills will need further analysis beyond what industry data is provided from burning glass. These include civil engineering and international studies which use a variety of applications when compared to information technologies. The following application-based skills will be mentioned below based on each group members ideal jobs.</p>

                  <h3> Albert: Chief Information Security Officer (CISO): </h3>
                    <p>A chief security officer (CISO) is responsible for the safety of storing data and information, preventing breaches from occurring internally. To do so, a strong understanding of programming languages is required to succeed in the field. According to burning glass 2018, the most practised languages are SQL with 17,570 overall positions offered for those knowledgeable on its usage. This is followed by the second most popular language being JavaScript with 15,336 listings with third place given to JAVA with 12,228 listings. Important to mention that a good understanding on how to use operating systems with respect to these languages such as Microsoft Windows (13,085 listings) and Linux (8,164) can play a key role for applicants to be accepted into the cybersecurity industry (Burning Glass, 2018). Furthermore, to get a better understanding of the priority’s technical skills, another source such as seek should be investigated. When observing chief security positions, a pattern can be formed highlighting JavaScript as the most optimal technical skill to have. As JavaScript was the most prevalent in current advertisement, it puts such cyber security candidates in the top priority to land a job with good fundamentals of its applications (SEEK, 2022). Lastly, industry security standards must be well understood and kept up with as these standards may change rapidly depending on what sector of security Albert may work for. These could include security Analyst (173 listings), security Architect (142 listings) or security consultant (107 listings) as examples (Burning Glass, 2018).

                   <h3> Kelvin: Senior Full Stack Developer:	</h3>
                   <p> A full stack developer job is designing user interface applications on websites. These include developing key interactions such as secure databases and servers. These interfaces must provide functionality to the consumer with relevant coding practises in android and IOS platforms for a good user experience. Some of the most important technical skills a stack developer should have been well understood fundamentals in HTML (1,005 listings), CSS (3,683 listings), JavaScript (15,336 listings) and repository Git (1,230 listings) repository systems. Furthermore, competence in server-side languages such as Python (1,150 listings), Java (2,860 listings) and .Net programming (6,838 listings) could be considered as well as the most popular database technology SQL (17,570 listings) (Hudson, 2022.). However, as industry trends may change and a new software language may become popular, attending seminars and constant market monitoring should also be required such as Kelvin could meet future market demands. This can be viewed from burning glass latest data set in March 2018, having 344 listings (Burning Glass, 2018). Furthermore, using current market listings in SEEK, the data illustrated the most desired technical languages are MySQL (549 listings) and JAVA (2,860 listings) as of 2022 (SEEK, 2022).

                   <h3> Ron: Senior Civil Engineer:	</h3>
                   <p> As mentioned, civil engineering technical skills differentiate from information technology as most programs are catered to drawing, simulating, or calculation-based applications for certain infrastructures. A civil engineer’s job is to maintain and sustain civil infrastructures. This can be done through demolition, construction, and recycling of materials to build new infrastructure or repair existing structures. For example, civil engineering branches into many fields including steel, concrete, water, structural, transport and geotechnical industries. As each individual civil field utilises different programs such as water toolkit, building information modelling (BIM), AutoCAD and Space Gass must be well understood from a graduate perspective as these key technical skills should carry over late into a civil engineer’s career. As Burning Glass could not be used for the civil field, seek highlighted that the most important skill to be integrated after graduating into a junior position is AutoCAD as it’s the most diverse technical skill that is most used in the industry (Seek, 2022; Cadgroup, 2022). However, this may be subjected to change in the coming years as BIM programs such as FormIt and Revit may become common practise in the civil engineering field (WGI, 2018). Lastly, as civil engineering is usually composed multi scaled projects involving large teams. To aid with time and cost managements a program such as Microsoft Projects could be implements to help finish tasks on time and effectively. This is the only technical skill listed in Burning Glass, having a low amount of job listings with only 73 total postings (Burning Glass 2018). </p>

                   <h3> Anin: Supply Chain Officer:</h3>
                   <p> A supply Chain Officers main objective is to continuously implement advancements in logistics and delivery systems. The job also includes the transfer of goods and services to consumers. Compared to IT, a supply chain officer has less technical requirements and more social soft interaction skills needed as mentioned in job descriptions in Seek. The main technical skills needed is a good management system. Therefore, applications such as Microsoft project (73 listings) as well as Microsoft excel (936 listings) are mentioned as desirable when looking at applications (Seek, 2022). Hence, a windows operating system (221 listings) should be used to run these software’s (Burning Glass, 2018). If better management systems are introduced in the future, Anin would have to learn an additional application to keep up with market trends, learning its functionality in relations to the supply chain industry. </p>
